For each of these query templates (name vs name.hyphens), try the following queries and note 
which ones return: a) Zero results, b) an iPhone related product (either the phone itself or an accessory),
c) non-iPhone related products:

iPhone
--> both iPhone related

i phone
--> name.hyphens has iPhone related results; name has non-iPhone related results

I-phone
--> name.hyphens has iPhone related results; name has non-iPhone related results

iPhone4
--> name.hyphens has iPhone related results; name has non-iPhone related results

Iphone4
--> both zero results
--> results when applying fuzzy matching (but not iPhone related when using name template and fuzziness of 2)
